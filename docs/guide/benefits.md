# Benefits

There are many benefits of using Lumin UI over other libraries like React, Fusion, or Vide. For a quick explanation, Lumin UI will offer great performance, ease of use, and minimal size.

## In-Depth

### React

React Lua is the default library for UI that comes to mind for Roblox related projects, but it wasn't originally built for this purpose in Roblox.

- Good but crowded API; many methods go unused due to the fact they aren't good in Roblox nature
- Bloated due to translation; the codebase is extremely large due to it being a 1:1 translation of JS and Luau
- Hard to learn properly and fully; not recommended for beginners because of how long it takes and how unique it is

### Fusion

Fusion is much better than React and is also a great option for Roblox UI development specifically. It does still have some issues, though.

- Forced memory management API; the `Scopes` feature was made for better management of memory, but it only complicates things for both small and big projects
- Internal code is hard to read; if an issue arises internally it might be hard for contributors to actually help and debug it
