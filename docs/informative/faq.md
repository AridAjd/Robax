# FAQ

FAQ or Frequently Asked Questions here at Aegis is a section where you'll find most of the answers to many important questions that many developers have already asked.

## Is Aegis really performant?

A: Yes! Aegis has been initially made with performance in mind. To get an elaborated answer to this question, you can visit the [Performance](/informative/performance) section.

## Is Aegis an alternative to Fusion?

A: Nope.

- Fusion is based on advanced and complex code design and structure making a dynamic and reactive code.
- Aegis is based on performance and simplicity both internally and externally.

As both projects have the same aim with different methods, it essentially depends upon your choice which one you'd like to use.

## Why Aegis when there is Fusion?

A: You see, Fusion (as of today, writing this docs) has been undergoing many codebase changes and many things are changing in Fusion. But that's not the case with Aegis. Aegis already has the main syntax in mind, and _if_ any things get added to Aegis that is subjected to change, we are going to notify the users of it being expected to change.
