# Performance

There's one thing that many developers always worry about when working on their game; performance. Using too much memory is bad and that leads to low performance, high ping etc.

But no worries, Aegis covers all that!

Aegis was developed with 2 things in mind:

- Simplicity
- Performance

Aegis was developed without any extra elements being left out so all the memory that Aegis uses always comes to use! There is one question though.

**_Q:_ How would I know if Aegis really is performant?**\
**_A:_** We could add in some images of Aegis benchmarks here, but there'd be no point in it as you won't understand how fast it _actually_ is.

That's why, we are comparing it to some other top-class UI frameworks; React/Roact and Fusion!
